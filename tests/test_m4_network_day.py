r"""M4 acceptance tests: the M3 network across a full day.

M4 is the cross product of two things already proved. M1 established that 24
hours on one bus are separable; M3 established the network in a single hour.
Nothing new is formulated here, so the risk is not that the formulation is
wrong -- it is that joining the two quietly breaks one of them:

    a constraint accidentally written across all t
        -> the hours couple through the flow limits, M1's separability dies,
           and every price is subtly wrong in a way no single hour reveals

    a PTDF built once and indexed per hour with a stale bus order
        -> prices land at the wrong buses, consistently, in all 24 hours

    a settlement identity checked on the DAY instead of per HOUR
        -> a positive residual in one hour cancels a negative one in another
           and a broken solve reports a clean zero

So the tests below are mostly the M1 and M3 tests re-run against a day, plus
the one property that is genuinely new: congestion appears in some hours and
not others, and the price regime changes with it.

              M1                    M3                    M4
        24 hours, 1 bus  x   1 hour, 5 buses   =   24 hours, 5 buses
        p[g,t]               p[g], f[l]            p[g,t], f[l,t]
        lambda[t]            lambda + PTDF.mu      lambda[t] + PTDF.mu[t]

Grouped by lifespan, not by milestone. TestForever holds on any network in any
milestone. TestSeparability is expected to FAIL at M6, for the same reason M1's
copy of it is -- startup cost and min up/down time couple the hours on purpose.
