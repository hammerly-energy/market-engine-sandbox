    A pure graph question -- reactance and limits play no part, only which
    buses a branch touches. Ordered by the bus order given, so the answer is
    reproducible rather than set-ordered.

    This exists because a disconnected network is the most common thing a user
    editing topology produces, and it is invisible in the linear algebra:

        A --AB-- B        C          B_bus is block diagonal. Each block has
                                     its own zero eigenvalue, so the matrix has
                                     TWO, and the single rank-1 fix in ptdf()
                                     only removes one. The inverse then fails
                                     with "Singular matrix" and names nothing.

    Deleting a line and typing a bus name twice both land on that same message
    from two modules away. Finding the components first turns it into a
    sentence about the network the user actually drew.
