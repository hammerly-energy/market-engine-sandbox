"""One call from a Scenario to a cleared, priced, settled market.

Everything here already existed, scattered across a __main__ block and a test
helper: build the PTDF, solve the LP, assemble the prices, check the identity.
Nothing new is formulated. What is new is that the whole pipeline has ONE name,
so a caller that is not a figure -- a parameter sweep, an HTTP handler, a
notebook -- can run a market without reassembling the sequence by hand and
getting one step subtly wrong.

    Scenario --> ptdf() --> solve_dispatch_network_day() --> lmps() --> settle()

The slack is an ARGUMENT, not a Scenario field. It is a choice this layer
makes, and per CLAUDE.md trap 2 nothing physical depends on it: changing it
shifts every LMP by a constant and moves no dispatch, no flow, and no price
DIFFERENCE. It defaults to whatever the config recorded so that the common
case needs no second argument.

def clear(scenario, slack=None, limits=None):
    """Clear, price, and settle every hour of a Scenario.

    Args:
        scenario: a Scenario carrying buses and branches. Single-bus scenarios
                  are rejected -- they have no network, and M0's solve_dispatch
                  is the right call for them.
        slack:    bus name. Defaults to scenario.provenance["slack"].
        limits:   {line: MW} overriding the branch ratings. The lever a sweep
                  or a UI slider pulls: pass {"DE": 240.0} to re-solve one
                  network at a different rating without rebuilding a Scenario.
                  Lines omitted keep their declared limit; np.inf is allowed
                  and means unlimited.

    Returns:
        A dict keyed by hour under "hours", with everything a caller needs to
        draw or serve the result. Dispatch, flows, mu and lmp are keyed by
        (name, hour) exactly as the solver returns them -- not re-nested --
        because a caller that wants one snapshot indexes once, and a caller
        that wants the day iterates, and neither has to undo a shape the other
        preferred.

    Raises:
        ValueError on a scenario this cannot price; RuntimeError from the
        solver if the LP is infeasible or unbounded.
