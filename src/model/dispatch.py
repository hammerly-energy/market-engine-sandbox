    -- islands --------------------------------------------------------------

    A disconnected network is not a broken network, it is two markets. The
    thing that makes it two is ONE BALANCE ROW PER COMPONENT:

        A ---- B ---- C        E        sum_g p == sum_i D   one row
                                        lets brighton at E serve B's load
        (the line to E is cut)          through a line that is not there

    So the balance is indexed by island, and lambda comes back keyed by
    (island, t). The island is named by its SLACK, because lambda IS the LMP
    at the slack -- an index would mean nothing to a reader and would
    renumber the moment another line is cut.

    Nothing else changes. m.inj, m.f and both flow limits are untouched,
    because a block-diagonal PTDF already says an injection in one island
    moves no line in another. See ptdf.ptdf_blocks.

    -- the demand side ------------------------------------------------------

    Demand arrives in two forms and they are not two code paths, they are one
    formulation with a term switched off:

        INELASTIC   D[i][t]     a constant on the right-hand side. Must be
                                served. This is M0-M4 exactly, and when there
                                are no bids the model below IS the M4 model,
                                variable for variable.

        ELASTIC     d[k,t]      a VARIABLE bounded 0..bid_mw[k,t], carrying a
                                benefit v[k] in the objective. The market may
                                decline to serve it, and declines exactly when
                                the price at its bus exceeds what it is worth.

    Which turns "minimise production cost" into "maximise welfare" -- consumer
    benefit minus production cost -- and the cost-minimising market is the
    special case where every consumer values power above every offer.

    THE BIG CONSEQUENCE: infeasibility from a capacity shortfall stops
    existing. With every MW of demand priced, a market that cannot serve it
    all serves the valuable part and prices at the valuation of the first MW
    it declined. That is a scarcity price, and it is an answer rather than a
    RuntimeError.

    -- why generation stays on the left -------------------------------------

    The balance is written

        sum_g p[g,t] == sum_i D[i,t] + sum_k d[k,t]

    with the new variables on the RIGHT, beside the constant they generalise,
    rather than moved across as -sum_k d. Algebraically identical; not
    identical to Pyomo. The dual's SIGN follows the form the row is written
    in, and every price in this repo -- and the settlement identity that
    checks them -- was verified against this arrangement. Flipping the row to
    put d on the left would negate lambda and break the published case5 LMPs
    in a way that looks like a PTDF error and is not.

    lambda therefore keeps its meaning unchanged: the marginal cost of one
    more MW of demand. With some demand inelastic it is the cost of one more
    MW of THAT demand; with all of it elastic the constant is zero and lambda
    is simply the clearing price. Same number, same row, same sign.

    Sits ALONGSIDE solve_dispatch_day, not in place of it. That one clears a
    single bus and its lambda is the whole price; this one adds the network,
    and lambda becomes only the energy component. Keeping both means M1's
    separability tests still have their model to run against.

    The two orderings above are the load-bearing part. PTDF[l, i] means
    nothing without knowing which l and which i, and a transposed row here
    reappears later as an inexplicable price at the wrong bus.

    Prices are NOT assembled here. This returns the two dual families raw;
    src/model/pricing.py combines them into
    LMP[i, t] = lmbda[t] + sum_l PTDF[l, i] * mu[l, t].

    Nothing here may reference two different t. That is still M1's rule --
    the network couples BUSES within an hour, never hours to each other.
