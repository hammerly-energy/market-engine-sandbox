r"""M4 figures: one network, twenty-four hours.

Three figures, in the order the argument runs.

    figure_context          the system every later panel is about
                            (a) the five buses, six lines and two ratings
                            (b) the offer stack against the day's load range
      |
      v
    figure_day_prices       what the day looks like from the demand side
                            (a) system load, congested hours shaded
                            (b) the five LMPs, converging and separating
      |
      v
    figure_day_dispatch     what the fleet and the network actually do
                            (a) dispatch by unit, stacked in merit order
                            (b) the DE corridor against its 240 MW limit
      |
      v
    figure_day_settlement   the acceptance criterion, drawn
                            (a) payments, revenue and congestion rent
                            (b) the settlement residual, hour by hour

The prices figure is the argument for M4 in one image. M3 could only ever show
one column of it: a single hour is either congested or it is not. Across a day
the DE corridor binds in the morning and releases at night, so the five prices
sit on top of each other for seven hours and fan out for the other seventeen.
The gap between those two states is what M4 exists to produce.

Nothing here is hand-placed. Every number comes from clear() on
configs/m4.yaml -- the same call the tests make -- so a figure that disagrees
with the model is a figure that cannot be drawn.

Panel (b) of the settlement figure is the M4 goal made visible: the residual of

    sum(load payments) - sum(generator revenue) == sum_l mu[l] * limit[l]

in every hour separately, against the 1e-6 tolerance the tests assert. It is
drawn on a log axis because the interesting claim is about ORDERS of magnitude
-- the residuals land around 1e-12, six decades under tolerance, and a linear
axis would draw all of them flat on zero and prove nothing.

Palette: Okabe-Ito, assigned to buses by position in configs/m4.yaml and never
cycled, so bus A is the same hue here as in the M3 figures. Generators take
their bus's hue, because a unit's location is what the network cares about.
